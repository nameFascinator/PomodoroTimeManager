This application is based on [🍅Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) which is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. It uses a kitchen ⌛timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This application has the option to choose: a 🛠️work interval, a ☕small pause interval, and a 🍲big pause interval(after 4 work intervals is a big pause). Also, an application would show the date-time and give voice announcements.

✅Requirements:

- Python 3.8 +
- PyQt6
- Winsound

💡or 

simply use the PomodoroTimeManager_Setup installer and install the program on your computer. To execute click the icon on your 👉screen or 👉PomodoroTimeManager.exe.
